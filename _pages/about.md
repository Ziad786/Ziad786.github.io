Hello, I am Ziad Rahman Bhuiyan. I am the founder of [Blind for Education](https://ziad786.github.io), a non-profit organization dedicated to provide a high-quality education to underprivileged students in Bangladesh, and also I have a non-profit organization named SHIELD that is mainly dedicated to work for the underprivileged poor people of Bangladesh to improve their lifestyle and acheive their basic rights. My professional endeavors aim to maximize the quality of life for individuals by operating at the intersection of education, technology, and health research.

I am interested in health science while focusing on bridging the gap between computational and experimental laboratories through highly engaging and fruitful collaborations.
